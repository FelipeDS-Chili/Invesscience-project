Invesscience is a project made in order to give a practical tool to investors along the hard way to find out profitable startups.

It is a different project, since it takes all the data about one startup until the moment of its Series A round of investment. So, it takes information about the founders like University Background, University Name, Sex of each Founder, Location of the startup, amount of investment until the Series A round, among others.

## Invesscience gives investors a model that recommends in which startup put their money in, it identifies easily good startups, but it also regards to be not too strict and do not lose a hidden jewell in the sea of startups.

In order to create Invesscience, it has been taken into account a long Dataset from CrunchBase, and it has been modified, in a process called feature engineering,  aiming to get the best features which explain the investment problem.

It has been developed four big stages:


## Data analysis

A deep data analysis using jupyter notebooks, to identify patterns in the data, and also to find out the nature of the outliers.


## Feature Engineering

With the Data Analysis it has been done a continues feature engineering, in order to get the type of data to use (text or numbers), in order to avoid the noise caused by the data in the model performance.

## Tracking of ML performance

It has been used the MLFlow tool in order to track all the performance and the score metric choosed.
The Score used has been F1- Score.

## Deployment on Heroku
